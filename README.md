# E-Commerce Funnel Analysis
## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform Funnel Analysis on an e-commerce websiteâ€™s user journey to identify where customers drop off, calculate conversion rates at each stage, and provide actionable business insights to improve overall conversions.

## ðŸ”„ Steps & Insights
Step 1: Data Loading & Cleaning

Datasets loaded: home_page_table (90,400 rows), search_page_table (45,200), payment_page_table (6,030), payment_confirmation_table (452), and user_table (90,400).

Merged into a unified dataset with user journeys across stages.

âœ… Insight: The dataset is well-structured, with user actions clearly separated into funnel stages.

## Step 2: Funnel User Counts

Home Page Visitors: 90,400

Search Page Visitors: 45,200 (â†“ 50% drop-off)

Payment Page Visitors: 6,030 (â†“ 86.6% drop-off from Search)

Payment Confirmation (Completed Purchase): 452 (â†“ 92.5% drop-off from Payment)

âœ… Insight: Only 0.5% of users (452/90,400) complete a purchase â€” extremely low.

## Step 3: Stage-wise Conversion Rates

Home â†’ Search: 50.00%

Search â†’ Payment: 13.34%

Payment â†’ Confirmation: 7.50%

Overall Funnel Conversion: 0.50%

âœ… Insight:

The biggest leak is between Search â†’ Payment (86.6% drop-off).

The final Payment â†’ Confirmation step loses 92.5% of users.

## Step 4: Drop-off Analysis

From Home â†’ Search: 45,200 users lost (50%).

From Search â†’ Payment: 39,170 users lost (86.6%).

From Payment â†’ Confirmation: 5,578 users lost (92.5%).

âœ… Insight: The checkout process (Payment & Confirmation) is the most critical bottleneck.

## Step 5: Trend Analysis (Monthly Conversion)

Conversion rates fluctuate monthly.

Around March 1st, a sharp drop in conversions occurred â†’ possible bug release / A/B test failure.

âœ… Insight: Technical or product changes in March severely impacted conversions.

## Step 6: Segmentation Analysis
### By Gender

Home â†’ Confirmation:

Female: 0.53%

Male: 0.47%

No significant difference â†’ gender not a major factor.

âœ… Insight: Gender balance is stable; drop-offs are similar for both groups.

### By Device

Home Visitors: Desktop = 60k, Mobile = 30k.

Final Conversion:

Desktop â†’ 0.25%

Mobile â†’ 1.00%

Mobile converts 4x better than Desktop.

âœ… Insight: Desktop users drop off disproportionately, especially during Payment & Confirmation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

Massive drop-offs: Only 0.5% of users purchase despite high traffic.

Search â†’ Payment stage (13% conversion) and Payment â†’ Confirmation (7.5%) are the weakest points.

March 1st bug/feature release caused a sudden drop.

Gender has no effect, but Device matters: Mobile performs far better than Desktop.

## âœ… Conclusion & Recommendations

Fix Checkout Flow

Desktop checkout needs urgent optimization.

Investigate confirmation failures â€” possible UX issues, bugs, or payment gateway problems.

Improve Search â†’ Payment Conversion

Users drop heavily here â†’ check product discovery, pricing, and cart usability.

Implement cart abandonment reminders and UX A/B tests.

Investigate March Drop

Analyze logs for Mar 1st release â†’ could be a payment bug or broken flow.

Leverage Mobile Strength

Mobile has 4x higher conversions.

Push more campaigns on Mobile, optimize mobile search & payments further.

Long-Term Improvements

Add heatmaps/session replays for checkout.

Conduct A/B testing on payment pages.

Personalize product recommendations to improve cart-to-payment conversion.

## ðŸš€ Impact

If the Search â†’ Payment and Payment â†’ Confirmation stages are optimized to even double their current conversion rates, the overall conversion rate could rise from 0.5% â†’ ~2%, a 4x improvement, leading to massive revenue growth.
